Conway's Game of Life.

A sample input file, pattern would be like this:

```
0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0
```

And output would look like :

```
0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0
```

you can try running with the sample input files:

```sh
  $ ruby bin/gameoflife.rb test.txt
  $ ruby bin/gameoflife.rb test2.txt
```

You can run the tests by running following commands from the root:

```sh
  $ rspec
```
